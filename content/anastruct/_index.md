Structural analysis is often done in proprietary software. For me this was often a burden in my quest of automation. Besides not being open source, there is most of the times no other way to interact with the program than using your mouse and keyboard. 

To be able to interact with 2D frames and trusses structural analysis, I wrote anaStruct. AnaStruct is a structural analysis package written in Python. Iterative mechanical problems can now easily be modelled.
