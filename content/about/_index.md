<p>Hi, my name is Ritchie Vink. Welcome on my blog. Here I post some of the results of the projects that keep me busy, or just things I've learned or found interesting. </p>

<p>I've switched jobs from being a Structural Engineer to Data Scientist
& Data Engineer. As a structural engineer my work was looking more and more
as the job of a data scientist / developer. I focused mainly on utilizing computational power to do some really cool engineering stuff.</p>

<p>I like the traction the whole machine learning science has at the moment. This was one the reasons for me to switch jobs and focus more on developing myself in that industry. My interests go both ways though. I realy like to combine the machine learning problems with the domain knowledge I've got from the engineering industry. The posts on this site will probably oscillate somewhat between both worlds sometimes.
</p>
