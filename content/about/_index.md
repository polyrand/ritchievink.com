<p>Hi, my name is Ritchie Vink. I am a nerd that can get really enthusiastic about abstract problems. This site
is a clustering of things I found interesting or things I worked on.</p>

<p>This year I've switched jobs from being a Structural Engineer at <a href="www.abt.eu">ABT</a> to Data Scientist
& Engineer at <a href="www.xomnia.com">Xomnia</a>. As a structural engineer my work was looking more and more
as the job of a data scientist / developer. I focused mainly on utilizing computational power to do some really cool engineering stuff.

I made the switch because I really like the multidisciplinary skill set that is need for applying data science
and managing big data. One major reason for my switch is that I want to keep learning new things. And with the traction that there is currently in artificial intelligence, data and computer science. I really think I can spend forever sucking it all up.
